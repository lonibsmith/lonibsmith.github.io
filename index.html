<h1>Loni's Portfolio</h1>
    <div id="bio">
        My Name is Loni Smith, and I hope you enjoy getting to know myself, along with the projects that I have been working on.<br><br> 

        I grew up between Utah and Arizona. While attending Highland High School in Gilbert Arizona I had the honor of being a part of Whoâ€™s Who Among American Students. The next year I moved to a small town in southern Utah where I graduated. I then made my way back to phoenix where I was married and attended college. After College I became a Well Planning Engineer for a company based out of Houston Texas. This job fit me well as I love learning, and there was endless opportunity for personal growth and development.<br><br> 
        
        By this point of my life my husband and I were blessed with three incredible kids, Two daughters and a son. My job allowed me to work from home which had some challenges, but also great benefits. <br><br>
        
        In 2015 I was laid off due to a major industry crash so we decided this would be an exciting time to move our family back to Utah for new opportunities. <br><br>
        
        I have worked in the finance industry since returning to Utah. In 2018 I discovered that my love for learning was not being met with my current job, so I went back to school for an MBA and finished in 2020. <br><br>
        
        I am now attending MIT, working on the Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN. I am very excited to learn a new subject and am hoping to start working in this new industry shortly after finishing. <br><br>
        
        My goal in my life is to teach my kids that you never stop learning. <br><br>
